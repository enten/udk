# Universal Angular Application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.1.

## Development server

Two different dev servers are provided:

* The universal dev server which enable SSR (build `browser` and `server` targets) ;
* The [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) dev server which is a [webpack dev server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) (build `browser` target only).

SPA dev server can be useless (or "broken"): it depends on your server implementation.

### Universal dev server

Run `npm run dev` (or `npx ng-udkc`) for an universal dev server. Navigate to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

The app will automatically hot-reload on server and browser sides if you change any of the source files.
